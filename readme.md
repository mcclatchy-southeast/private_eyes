# Private Eyes

North Carolina law enforcement agencies in recent years have installed hundreds of cameras across the state that capture data on every vehicle â€” 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

The data on millions of cars these cameras capture can be accessed by law enforcement for up to 30 days without a warrant. And the biggest competitor in the industry, Flock Safety, allows departments to link their data collected by these privately-owned cameras, vastly increasing the surveillance power of even the smallest department.

Below, you'll find links to our reporting and resources and data that powered the investigation.

## How we did this story

No agency tracks the use of automated license plate readers across the state, so The News & Observer began a reporting project in 2023 to find out just how widespread the devices have become among law enforcement agencies.

The project focused specifically on fixed automated license plate readers, rather than those mounted in police or sheriff's vehicles, because of an ongoing debate in the N.C. General Assembly about allowing the stationary devices on state-maintained roads and highways.

The industry's biggest competitor, Flock Safety, several years ago began offering clients the ability to publish "transparency portals" providing high-level details of their ALPR programs. This can include data on usage policies, the number of cameras and details about the frequency of alerts and searches for each department.

But the portals are optional for each client. In July 2023, Flock Safety declined to provide a list of these transparency sites for its law enforcement clients. So The News & Observer set out to find as many as possible.

The initial list of web addresses was created after looking for transparency portals on multiple search engines. Because the pattern of the web addresses were relatively consistent, the N&O also created a list of known Flock clients and possible URLs, which it regularly tested with code.

More web addresses were added after the N&O began surveying more than 150 North Carolina law enforcement agencies to ask about their use of ALPR vendors and whether they had launched a transparency portal for their own activity.

The N&O supplemented its lists with records from the State Bureau of Investigation, which was able to provide details on which agencies obtained access to data extracts from the National National Crime Information Center, which tracks vehicles and license plates of wanted suspects. This data is linked to the Flock Safety system to match and provide automatic alerts on vehicles of interest that pass by the agency's license plate cameras.

After building the list, the N&O used code to regularly collect data on each site from late July to mid-April to better understand, based on publicly available information, how the devices are used.

Details gathered from the sites also revealed which police and sheriff's departments were granted access to an agency's camera data. The N&O used this list of "external organizations" to construct and test for additional transparency portals, based on the previously discovered standard URL pattern.

It's hard to know how many existing portals the N&O has captured among the company's more than 5,000 clients.

But in April, Flock did provide a list of 33 North Carolina agency portals. Comparing the two lists, The N&O's was missing 3 of active sites, while the company omitted one from the reporter's list.

In all, the project as of mid-April collected data on more than 360 Flock transparency sites.
